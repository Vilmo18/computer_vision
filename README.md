# Training basic CNNs from scratch 

The main idea is to investigate in various architecture of NN to solve the classification problem on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- As we see ANN are not adapted for this kind of problem witth we can notice the very bad performance
- Between the model 1 and model 2 we notice a very improvement of the result is still bad and the model goes to overfitting more fastly
- To reduce this problem of overfitting we've added a dropout layer and we can notice a very good result
- For the model 4, we still try to accelerate the convergence of the model with batchNormalisation and and an adaptative learning rate
- For the model 5, we increase the depth of the network to help the model to capture more detail and we added some regularizer at each layer
