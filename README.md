# Training Basic CNNs from Scratch

The primary goal is to explore various neural network architectures to solve the classification problem on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **Initial Attempts with ANN:** We observed very poor performance, indicating that ANNs are not suitable for this type of problem.
- **Model 1(CONV2D + MaxPool) vs. Model 2(CONV2D + CONV2D + MaxPool):** There was a significant improvement in results between these models, although Model 2 still overfitted quickly.
- **Model 3 (Introducing Dropout):** Adding a dropout layer effectively mitigated overfitting and yielded significantly better results.
- **Model 4 (Batch Normalization and Adaptive Learning Rate):** These additions helped accelerate model convergence.
- **Model 5 (Increased Depth and Regularization):** Increasing the network depth allowed the model to capture more details. Additionally, regularizers at each layer further enhanced performance.
